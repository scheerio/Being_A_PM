# Being_A_PM

I was curious about what it means to be a product manager. Here's my brief take on what it means to be a product manager, based on research, learnings, and online lectures. This includes frameworks to be aware of, tools to know, definitions, and more!

# What is product management? 

The role of a product manager is often ambiguous – it changes across different industries and companies. You are not the manager of anybody, but you are a communicator that puts all the pieces together by getting feedback from everyone else. In summary, a PM is a communications hub, a prioritizer, a researcher, and most importantly, the person most responsible for the ultimate success of the product.

# What is a product? 

A product can be anything. Sometimes there are smaller products within larger products. A PM is not always in charge of an entire product, but only certain parts of it. PMs can be split up by feature, by platform, and more.

# Are there different types of PMs? 

When working on a product, you keep in mind the stakeholders, including users of the product as well as executives. Because there are different stakeholders, there are actually three types of PMs. An internal PM works on products for the company itself to use (not for external customers) – the stakeholder is internal. A business-to-business (or software as a service) PM works on products designed to solve problems for other companies. A business-to-consumer PM works on products for customers, and spends a lot of time talking to consumers. 

# Which type of PM would you want to be? 

The B2B PM role is a good intro role with a small number of users (more than Internal PM role, but less than B2C PM role), and it allows you to be flexible and creative. Priorities are weighted by profits/losses involved and there are tight deadlines. The Internal PM role is a great intro role too because you integrate with other systems, learn a lot about technology, and there is less risk with fewer users. You do end up doing a lot of project management. For the B2C PM role, there is a lot of uncertainty and pressure, with millions of users and multiple platforms involved. There is high risk to the company and you have to do extensive user testing, but you learn a lot.

# What’s the difference between product vs. project management? 

As a product manager, you need to have project management skills. Product managers are successful for the success of the product while project managers are responsible for accomplishing a project (not a goal). For products, success is defined by KPIs or metrics, and the method by which goals are reached is not defined – usually up to them and the team. A project usually has a timeline and a budget as a constraint.

# What’s a normal day like for a typical PM? 

A day as a PM is always dynamic, but example activities include:
•	Check emails and tech news, make sure you’re up to date with the industry
(https://www.producthunt.com/, https://news.ycombinator.com/, https://www.techmeme.com/, https://www.launchticker.com/)
•	Analyze the metrics dashboard
•	Standup meetings and metric updates
•	Meet with designers to talk about current problems and feedback and think about new solutions
•	Write specs, tickets, user stories for upcoming features
•	Test latest mobile release and test on different platforms, report bugs
•	Meet with team to do sprint planning or retrospective
•	Meet with other PMs that are stakeholders
•	Meet with data science team and look at exploratory data from user behavior
•	Look at user tests of new features
•	Present metrics milestones to executives, investors, other PMs
•	Present a recent accomplishment
•	Open houses
•	Meet with new employers for orientation

# Why is being a PM awesome? 

As a PM, you’re a communicator and a jack-of-all-trades. You get to influence every part of your business and interact with every key person on every team. PMs have incredible career potential.

# What are the phases of a company/product? 

Introduction (Dreem), growth (Snapchat), maturity (Twitter), decline (Yahoo). You can tell which stage you are in by how much revenue and sales are growing and by other things like how fast they are growing.

# What about phases of products on a smaller scale?

•	Conceive
(find user problems and think of solutions)
•	Plan
(roadmaps, interviews, research)
•	Develop
(make timelines, write features, stories, estimations, requirements)
•	Iterate
(finish the MVP or early prototype, test assumptions, use tools for testing different versions of the product)
•	Launch
(work with marketing team, legal team, PR team, sales team, and position for public launch, see the reaction)
•	Steady state
(collect metrics, optimize metrics, sales continue)
•	Maintain or kill
(analyze data to see return on investment and how competitive the product is, decide to kill or maintain it, may not fit company’s vision anymore or may not make revenue -- if kill, called “sun-setting”)

# What is Lean?

This product development philosophy is about cutting all of the unnecessary work/effort until you’re absolutely sure you need to do it.

# What is Agile?

Agile is a way of applying the lean mindset to software development. In this framework, we group things into small batches and do them one by one, in order to not waste resources. 

# What is Scrum?

There are two Agile development methodologies: Scrum and Kanban. Scrum is the most common and includes:
•	The sprint planning meeting
•	The start of the development process
•	Standup meetings
•	Retrospective meetings

# What about Kanban?

It’s not as strict as Scrum in terms of meetings and times. A Kanban board has columns with cards that you can move from one column to another, to reflect the state of the item: “To do”, “In progress”, “Done”. Kanban doesn’t use sprints. It’s more relaxed, but this makes it more difficult to evaluate how much time it’s going to take to develop items.

# What is the Waterfall framework?

This is the opposite of Agile. With this, we take all of the features of a product and develop them all at the same time. This is risky and it’s much harder to adapt to market feedback.

# How do you handle ideas and user needs?

Any product was first someone’s idea. A PM is not the idea person. Instead, a PM gathers ideas from everyone and decides what to build and when to build it, given all things happening in the company and in the market. Ideas come from employees, metrics, users, and clients. For Internal PMs, many ideas come from stakeholders. For B2C PMs, many ideas come from users, metrics, and coworkers. For B2B PMs, many ideas come from employees and clients.

# How do you figure out what users want?

You can get a list of ideas, but you don’t just go out and build them. Being a PM means being able to understand the real problems behind what people ask you to build. It’s all about finding the solution to a problem, instead of trying to fit the problem to a solution. When someone asks you to build something, ask yourself: Is this solving an actual problem? Can this have any unintended side effects? The easiest way to get to the core is by asking “Why?” over and over again.

# What’s the difference between users and customers?

Sometimes the people who pay for your product (customers) are not the same people are using it (users). The company that buys it will give you feedback about general features that they need it to have. The actual users will give you feedback about technical issues they encounter while using the product.

# How do you size the market?

Your approach can be top down (find total market and estimate what your share of that market is, an optimistic approach) or bottom up (based on thinking about current sales of similar product and estimating how much of those sales you can capture, more conservative, best way to do it but it takes more effort and time). There are several great resources for looking at market data, including compete.com, and searching “industry reports for ____” in Google.

# How do I find competitors?

You need to collect info on competitors and make judgments on what it means for your product. If there are no competitors, figure out why. You are in charge of feature triage. The features you choose must get you more users, make your users happy, and/or enhance your brand. You can’t make decisions until you know what your competitors look like, what they’re doing, and what they offer now. Record every single competitor you find, and list the competitors as either Known or Unknown. If unknown, use three techniques:
•	Channel the type of user
•	Search for “site: [popular site]” and your search term
•	Search for exact phrases using quotation marks

There are four main types of competitors. Direct (going after your customers), Indirect (solving your problem in a different way), Potential (offer something to same target customers but don’t solve the same problem), and Substitute (solves same core problem but usually doesn’t target same people). There are five dimensions used to compare yourself to competitors:
•	The product core
•	Size of their user base
•	Design
•	Brand
•	Speed

There are ways to keep track of competitors over time – three main events to look for: funding, acquisitions, and new feature/product launches. There are great resources for looking all of this up.

# What is a feature table?

It’s a comparison chart used to compare our product to a competitor’s product on a list of dimensions. On X axis but direct competitors and one Y axis list features/factors you want to compare. See what others are doing wrong and right and how your product differentiates.

# What is customer development?

This is a tool used to see if you’re building the right thing. It’s the practice of establishing a communications line with customers so you have come up with ideas, hypotheses, try them out, get feedback, and adapt your product. The cycle is: validation, development, and iteration. Mainly, you interview customers for this. There are different types of interviews: exploratory, validation, satisfaction, efficiency, or a mix of all of these. Depending on what stage the product is in, the approach to customer development is different. You can find people to interview on LinkedIn, forums, your competitors, and more. Post-product, you can use the company’s live chat system, your blog, power users, or twitter. To get people talking, be short, personal, and valuable. There is a specific structure for emails to send people, too. In the intro, say where you found them and mention the problem you noticed they have. Say you want to solve their problem but need their help to do so. Schedule a time to chat. During an interview, don’t talk about your solution, don’t talk about your own opinions, create a comfortable environment, don’t force the conversation, and when stuck say “that’s interesting, tell me more.” In terms of questions, ask open ended ones, don’t ask binary or hypothetical ones or leading ones or ones that might make them lie. Create a user persona, a fictional person to represent groups of similar users that behave in certain ways. 

# How do you figure out your target group?

Your target group may change depending on if you’re pre-product or post-product. If you’re not sure what the target is, write down the potential groups and compare them on three criteria: size, pain/payment, and accessibility. 

# What information do I gather?

Customer interviews don’t scale and data is qualitative, so other info is needed, including internal feedback, user test data, online feedback, analytic stats, news, market trends, and info from watching competitors. 

# What’s a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

This is a version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. You are concerned with how failure influences your company’s brand. There are seven steps involved with an MVP experiment:
•	Figure out problem/solution set
•	Identify assumptions and find riskiest
•	Build hypothesis around assumptions
•	Establish minimum criteria for success
•	Pick type of MVP you will run and your strategy
•	Execute the experiment
•	Evaluate and learn 

To figure out assumptions, you say, “in order for my idea to be successful, the following must be true…” and the riskiest assumptions mean that if that assumption isn’t true, the product will fail. Prioritize what you test by risk and difficulty using the risk/difficulty square. Now make a hypothesis, which is a testable statement of what you believe to be true in regards to the assumptions. Now you need to establish a concept called Minimum Criteria for Success (MCS) to decide if the product is worth building or not. In the end, the cost must be lower than the reward. MCS usually includes number of shares, percentage of people that sign up, and more. There are different types of MVPs: 
•	The email MVP
•	Shadow button MVP
•	404 and coming soon page
•	Explainer videos
•	Fake landing page pitch experiment MVP
•	Concierge service MVP
•	Piecemeal MVP
•	Wizard of Oz MVP

All of these have pros and cons. MVPs return quantitative data. Put together qualitative and quantitative data to see if the MVP experiment was successful. 

# What is wireframing?

Wireframes are visual guides for websites or apps that lay out the rough structure for where the content is going to go. These are different from mockups (more details) and from prototypes (handle usability). Tools like Balsamiq and Axure help with this. Sketch is more for mockups. 

# What are metrics?

Feedback loops are important. Metrics are numbers/measurements that describe what’s going on with your product – also called KPIs. Examples include monthly active users, returning users, app store reviews, and more. There are growth and engagement metrics, but also retention, user happiness, and revenue metrics. Good metrics are understandable, a rate/ratio, correlated, and changeable. HEART is a great framework for this: Happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success. For every metric, track goals, signals, and metrics. There is also the AARRR (Pirate) metrics framework: Acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue. Tools for all of this include Google Analytics, CrazyEgg, and more.

# What are epics?

An epic is a grouping of one or more features or functionalities that we want to build. Not all things we do as a product team result in a new feature for an outside user, which is why they are not called features. They often take longer than one sprint to build. If shorter than a sprint, called user stories. Epic spec sheets are documents that contain all the requirements for building the product: Introduction, product requirements, design requirements, and engineer requirements.

# What are user stories?

They describe a thing we’re going to build that delivers some type of functionality to the end user. The format is, “An an X, I want to do Y, so that I can Z.” Acceptance criteria are a set of conditions that software must satisfy in order to be considered complete.

# How do you handle estimations and velocity?

Story points can measure difficulty of tasks by using a rating system that everybody in the company understands. Velocity refers to the number of story points people were able to accomplish in a 2 weeks sprint. 

# How do you handle roadmapping?

They are usually inaccurate, but they are good to have as a general guide. Companies like roadmaps because executives/investors like to see quarter-based maps, and you could be against an actual deadline.

# How do you handle prioritization?

Use assumption testing, the BUC method (business benefits, user benefits, cost),  and the MOSCOW method (must, could, should, would).

# How do you communicate?

Use meetings, conference calls, emails, and informal meetings.

# How do you work with engineers?

With engineers you need to describe everything clearly and in details, including technical info. Keep tech debt and the future in mind.

# How do you work with designers?

Provide freedom, don’t tell them what to do, don’t treat them as an agency, and show all data involved in the project.

# How do you work with executives?

Be brief, speak in terms of business effect, communicate in their style.

# How should I talk about different technology topics?

The cloud is just a buzzword for the internet. A server stores data and client accesses servers to get data. Front end is usually HTML/CSS/JS while backend is usually MySQL and Amazon databases. The application layer is usually done with Ruby, Python, or PHP. The API (application programming interface) is a messenger that takes requests and tells the system what you want to do, and returns what you wanted back to you. Know about frameworks like Ruby on Rails for Ruby. Know SQL and Python too.

# What questions should I think about for being a PM?

When have you needed to prioritize?
When have you talked to users of a product you made?
When have you given feedback?
When have you acquired data to make decisions or give feedback?
When have you worked on something in multiple teams?
When have you improved the efficiency of a process?

# What are questions a PM may be asked?

Really anything, but examples include: What are the biggest obstacles for the company next year? What’s your thought on that latest feature your competitor launched? The list goes on and on.
